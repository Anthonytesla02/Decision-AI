# Fix Git Push Error - Step by Step

## The Error You're Getting
```
PUSH_REJECTED
The push was rejected by the remote. This is usually because the remote has commits that aren't in the local repository.
```

## Solution: Force Push with Lease

Run these commands in order:

### Step 1: Clear any locks
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock .git/config.lock
```

### Step 2: Check current status
```bash
git status
```

### Step 3: Add all files
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 4: Commit your changes
```bash
git commit -m "Decision AI with Paystack integration - Ready for deployment"
```

### Step 5: Force push (this will overwrite remote conflicts)
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## Alternative: If Force Push Doesn't Work

### Option A: Pull and merge first
```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push origin main
```

### Option B: Reset and force push
```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
git add .
git commit -m "Decision AI with Paystack integration"
git push --force origin main
```

## Nuclear Option: Fresh Repository

If nothing works, create a completely fresh setup:

```bash
# Remove git folder
rm -rf .git

# Start fresh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Decision AI"
git remote add origin https://github.com/Anthonytesla02/Decision-AI.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## If Authentication Issues Persist

1. **Use Personal Access Token**: 
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Create new token with `repo` permissions
   - Use token as password when prompted

2. **Configure Git credentials**:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
   ```

## Quick Fix Commands (Run in Terminal)

Copy and paste these commands one by one:

```bash
# Clear locks
rm -f .git/index.lock .git/config.lock

# Add and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Decision AI ready for deployment"

# Force push
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## Expected Result
After successful push, you should see:
```
Enumerating objects: XX, done.
Counting objects: 100% (XX/XX), done.
Delta compression using up to X threads
Compressing objects: 100% (XX/XX), done.
Writing objects: 100% (XX/XX), XX.XX KiB | XX.XX MiB/s, done.
Total XX (delta XX), reused XX (delta XX), pack-reused 0
To https://github.com/Anthonytesla02/Decision-AI.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
```

## What to Do Next
Once your code is pushed to GitHub:
1. Go to vercel.com
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Add your Paystack API keys as environment variables
4. Deploy!

Your Decision AI app is ready - we just need to get it on GitHub!
